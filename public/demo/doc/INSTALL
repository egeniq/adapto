Installing the ATK5 demo
------------------------

1. Install this demo somewhere into the document root of your
   PHP-enabled webserver.

2. Run ./setup.sh with the username of the webserver as parameter.
   This will make certain files writable by the webserver. If your
   webserver is running as user 'www', run the script like this:

   ./setup.sh www

   If the script fails, you may not be allowed to chown the files
   in the atktmp directory. In this case, you may have to run the
   setup.sh script as root.

   (Note to windows users: in general this step is not necessary if you run
   the demo on a Windows server.)

3. For MySQL databases, install the install_mysql.sql file from the
   main directory, into a mysql database. For Oracle databases, use the
   install_oracle.sql file. For postgresql databases, use install_pgsql.sql.
   For all three, make sure that you use the correct user/schema to install
   the file into!

4. Enter the username/password/host/databasename for this database into
   the config.inc.php file. Leave all other config options to their default
   at first. After you viewed the demo, and want to experiment, you can
   change the settings, but first try to get a running demo.

   Note: for oracle, if you connect using a TNS name, you can leave the
   $config_databasehost blank, and put the TNS name into $config_databasename

5. Browse the directory where you installed the demo with a webbrowser.
   You can login using 'administrator' as username and 'demo' as password.
