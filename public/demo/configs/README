Module specific configuration files can be placed in this directory.

They should have the following naming convention:

<modulename>.inc.php

The contents of each file should look like:

<?php
  
  $config["key"] = "value";

?>

Values can be retrieved using:

$value = atkConfig::get("modname", "key", "defaultvalue");

atkConfig takes care of including the file when it needs to.
