Adapto
======

Adapto is a small PHP framework targeted at creating data management applications with minimal amounts of code. 

It has the following major features:

* Compatible with Zend Framework (integrates nicely into ZF applications)
* Basic CRUD functionality for relational databases with only a few lines of code

Adapto is suitable for a number of use cases:

* Micro CMS systems
* Data management applications

Adapto is essentially a Zend Framework port of the classic (and by now outdated) ATK framework (http://atk-framework.com).

FAQ

## What does the name adapto mean?

Adapto is short for ADvanced APlication TOolkit. It's also highly adaptable. 

## Why are all the classes prefixed with Atk?

The prefix 'Atk' used in classes is short for Adapto Tool Kit, but is also a reference to the origin of the framework, the 'Achievo ToolKit' or ATK, the framework that formed the basis of Adapto.
