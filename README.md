Adapto
======

Adapto is a small PHP framework targeted at creating data management applications with minimal code, and is especially suited to:

* Enterprise CRUD applications
* Micro CMS systems
* Data management applications, glue and reporting

Adapto takes concepts proven by the [ATK framework](http://www.atk-framework.com) (created by [ibuldings](http://www.ibuildings.nl/) ) to the next level, and is led by Ivo Jansch, former ibuildings CTO and the 'inventor' of [ATK](http://www.atk-framework.com) and [Achievo](http://www.achievo.org) - a GPL resource and project management application based on ATK and used internally by ibuildings and their clients). Adapto concentrates on what makes it unique, and uses Zend Framework for caching, view rendering, database connectivity, etc.  

Documentation is maintained in the [SourceForge Adapto Project](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/adapto). See [Project Roadmap](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/adapto/index.php?title=Project_Roadmap) for current project priorities, and [Development Process] (http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/adapto/index.php?title=Development_Process) for how to get started (fork, pull, test, update, send pull-request). Adapto is pre-alpha, but worth installing the demo and having on your watch list.

The Adapto developers mailing list is where the day-to-day development discussions and decisions happen, although traffic is currently low. There's a post when something big happens, but development is pretty much driven by Ivo and there's an update when there's something to share (browse the mail archives, it won't take too long). Join the mailing list and stay current with the project so you can get more involved when the right is right (which could be now ;-)  ).
